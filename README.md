# Operational Training Resources

These resources provide some concrete resources to complement Curity's [Operational Training](https://curity.io/training/) courses.\
Complete the courses for your role(s) to earn Curity certifications.

## Training Roles

There are three roles, targeted at people who manage the Curity Identity Server:

| Role | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Curity Certified Operator | A person who manages deployments, infrastructure and reliable operation. |
| Curity Certified Administrator | A person who manages security settings for APIs and clients. |
| Curity Certified Developer | A person who extends the login screens or customizes security. |

Typically:

- An operator has the strongest infrastructure skills.
- An administrator has the deepest security knowledge.
- A developer has the strongest coding skills.

In some cases, a single person, like a specialist developer, may complete all certifications.
