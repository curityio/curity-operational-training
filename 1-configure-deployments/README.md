# Configure Deployments

These resources accompany the lessons from the [Configure Deployments](https://curity.io/training/configure-deployments) course.\
They demonstrate how you should enable deployment pipelines and evolve your configuration.

- The initial deployment and generation of default configuration.
- Redeployments with the latest configuration and control over external URLs.
- Run a cluster with high availability OAuth endpoints.
- Integrate refinements like split configuration.
- Create protected stage-specific secrets on every deploymeent.
- Use service roles for greater control over OAuth endpoints.
