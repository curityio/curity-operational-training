# Configure Deployments

These resources accompany the lessons from the [Configure Deployments](https://curity.io/training/configure-deployments) course.\
They demonstrate how you should enable deployment pipelines and evolve your configuration.

- 1. The initial deployment and generation of default configuration.
- 2. Redeployments with the latest configuration and control over external URLs.
- 3. Run a cluster with high availability OAuth endpoints.
- 4. Integrate refinements like split configuration.
- 5. Create protected stage-specific secrets on every deploymeent.
- 6. Use service roles for greater control over OAuth endpoints.

## Deployment Steps

Read the [Local Computer Setup](../SETUP.md) document to learn how to deploy and use the system.
