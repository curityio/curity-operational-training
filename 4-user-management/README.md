# User Management

These resources accompany the lessons from the [User Management](https://curity.io/training/user-management) course.\
The deployment shows how to implement the following tasks:

- Expose User Management APIs and restrict allowed clients with an Attribute Authorization Manager.
- Run the DevOps Dashboard as a client of the Curity Identity Server's GraphQL APIs.
- Act as an employee then creates customer user accounts and sets built-in or custom user attributes.

## Deployment Steps

Read the [Local Computer Setup](../SETUP.md) document to learn how to deploy and use the system.
