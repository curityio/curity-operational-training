## User Management

This deployment gets these areas up and running, to back up the course theory:

- Design and create customer user accounts.

## User Authentication

- Provide a setup that allows customer users to sign in with passwords or passkeys, with email account recovery.

- Use a username authenticator in applications to enable both customer users and employee users.
